 * An inbound control command directed at an active workflow execution.

 * behavioural change: stop the workflow, restart it, or replay from a specific node. Commands are
 * emitted onto the Control Bus and routed through registered {@code ControlSignalProcessor}
 * implementations before producing a {@code WorkflowDirective}.
 *
 * @param type the kind of action being requested
 * @param workflowId the workflow to target
 * @param sessionId the session that owns the workflow
 * @param targetNodeId optional node identifier; required for {@link CommandType#RESTART_FROM_NODE}
